# DNRECcolors
DNRECcolors is intended to be used by Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) employees who use ggplot2 in R to create graphics that follow DNREC brand guidelines. DNRECcolors has 5 built-in color palettes that are based off the DNREC Brand and Editorial Style Guide July 2021 edition. 

DNRECcolors was inspired by and copied from the (awesome) ggsci package for ggplot which can be found here: https://github.com/nanxstats/ggsci
